Welcome to Unruly, a thrilling 2D shooting game where your aim determines your fate! As the player, your objective is to eliminate enemies while navigating within a limited area. But here's the twist: when you shoot, your character moves in the opposite direction of the shot angle.

Prepare yourself for an intense challenge that combines precise aiming, strategic movement, and quick reflexes. Take control of your character's aim, pointing it directly at your cursor's position. Use your shooting skills to take down relentless enemies, but be prepared to dodge and maneuver as your character reacts in reverse.

Survival depends on your ability to adapt to the dynamic battlefield and make every shot count. Engage in fast-paced combat, explore different levels, and outwit your opponents with clever positioning and calculated shots.

Unruly features captivating 2D visuals that immerse you in its action-packed world. With limited space to navigate, every decision and shot you take matters. Can you master the art of shooting and movement to become the ultimate champion of Unruly?

Prepare yourself for an adrenaline-pumping adventure where precision meets survival. Aim, shoot, and embrace the chaos in Unruly!
